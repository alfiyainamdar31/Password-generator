## Overview
This is a simple Python script that generates a random password based on a user-specified length. The password includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

## Features
- Generate strong, random passwords of any length.
- Ensures a mix of character types including letters, digits, and special characters.
